SystemC sandbox, initially branched from version 2.3.2 downloaded from [here](http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc)

## SystemC 2.3.2
Standards are developed in a collaborative and open environment by technical working groups. Working groups operate by building consensus regarding requirements, proposed new features, and implementation. Ultimately these may become part of a future standard. Participation in the technical working groups is the primary way that progress is made in improving the SystemC language, implementation, and associated libraries.

All of our members and community are welcome to download the specifications and documents made publicly available by the working groups.

Note: In 2016 Accellera re-licensed all SystemC supplemental material under the Apache 2.0 License. Access to some previous releases of SystemC material may still require acceptance of the terms of the SystemC Open Source License while the process of updating license statements is underway. Please contact the Accellera office if you have any questions.
